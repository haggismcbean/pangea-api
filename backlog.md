- [ ] Implement the locationZones logic

Location Zones. Each location can have many zones. Each starts with one, which is of size 100 (or something). It can then be split up at a later date as and when users enter it and so on and so forth. Depending on the size of the zone, you can see things in it or not (randomness roll?). For now we won't worry about that though.

Zone Table
```
id
locationId
name
size
```

- [ ]Extend the Item Owner Model to allow for items placed in zones!!!

- [ ] Add things like hunger values to the current plant generator code
