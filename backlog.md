good next steps:

Implement a simple 'you woke up' kind of message
Show currently available options
 - travel (direction)
 - gather (plants)
 - chat (only to everyone for now)
 - hunt <?>
 - see inventory
 - see what's lying around
 - day/night cycle

Backend we can nearly start implementing some actual endpoints rather than all this hand wavey general database stuff:
 - animal products
 - plant products

 see plants endpoint
 gathering plant products endpoint
 hunting endpoint
 inventory endpoint
 whats in location endpoint (on ground)
 create tools endpoint
 recheck/reimp travel endpoint
