- [x] Add support for gathering all the different bits of a plant
- [x] Ensure you aren't creating loads of duplicate item entries

- [ ] Add things like hunger values to the current plant generator code... Or maybe start with an recipes thing and add them to that! No, it should be on the item. The reason? Once we start creating meals, they'll be items. And they'll have a hunger value. BUT not all items will have a hunger value. So maybe the meals aren't items, but MEALS and items can be of type meal. That works for me. SO - first, add base hunger values to plants, and then after that, add recipes one day (not urgent)

- [ ] I think after that it makes sense to start storing hunger and health on characters as well :)
